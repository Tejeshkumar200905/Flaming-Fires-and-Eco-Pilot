Eco - Pilot is a smart waste segregating system that can separate metal waste, dry waste and wet waste. It can mainly be used in mining and in warehouses to segregate different types of waste. It consists of Induction Proximity Sensor, Moisture Detecting Sensor, BO Motor, Auton Shield, Arduino Uno, Lithium-Ion Battery and Conveyor Belt. The sensor which is first in line in the conveyor belt is the Induction Proximity Sensor. When it detects a metal item, the BO Motor connected to it moves a handle which pushes the item into a box to contain metal waste. The sensor which is second in line in the conveyor belt is the Moisture Detecting Sensor. When it detects a wet item, the BO Motor connected to it moves a handle which pushes the item into a box to contain wet waste. Finally, if the waste is dry, it falls into a box to contain dry waste, which is at the end of the conveyor belt.
